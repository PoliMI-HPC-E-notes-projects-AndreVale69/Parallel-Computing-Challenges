# Challenge 2

## Challenge rules

- Groups up to 3 people
- One week of time
- The aim is to implement an efficient 2D-convolution algorithm in CUDA.
    - The size of the mask should be parametric.
    - Show the differences between the implementation with and without tiling.
    - Analysis of different implementations with different tiling size: optimize the performance given a specific Colab GPU.
    - Submit a google Colab file (.pynb) where you show your finding.
    - Submitting a file other than .pynb is possible, but it requires prior discussion with prof.
    - Provide a short report (max 2 pages) where you present your finding:
       - Experimental setup
       - Performance measurements
       - Explanation of design choices
       - No screenshots of the code!
